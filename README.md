requires the CEP and PRC.
Please send help for readme creation help.
What have I gotten myself into?
Oh right tools. Well you need the NWN 1 toolset obviously. https://github.com/NearInfinityBrowser/NearInfinity/wiki is Near Infinity for pulling resources from IWD 2.
http://www.gameapps.com/idw.htm Infinity Dialog Workshop is very useful for viewing Dialog options.
